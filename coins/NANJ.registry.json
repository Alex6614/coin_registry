    "en": "NANJCOIN is a volunteer community developed and operated token based on the Ethereum token that originated in 2ch.sc, a Japanese internet community.\nNANJCOIN is a sports lovers token, for baseball in particular, that is rarely seen internationally. In February 2018, we had a free distribution event (airdrop), after which we listed on overseas exchanges and planned for the opening game (pre-sale). In the future, we aim to expand into various sports fields and to donate to players and teams. â€» NANJCOIN is the born from the fan community, and has no relationship at all with 2ch.sc management, 5ch operation, etc."
