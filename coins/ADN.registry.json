    "en": "Aiden is a cryptocurrency that uses the Scrypt-OG hashing algorithm. OG stands for Optimized for GPU. Scrypt-OG is an optimized version of Scrypt that is 8 times less memory intensive than traditional Scrypt. Scrypt-OG is quite similar to Scrypt-N, except that the N-factor will always remain at 6. This helps make the GPU run cooler and providing more MH/s for the GPU."
