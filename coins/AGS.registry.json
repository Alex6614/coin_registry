    "en": "Aegis was designed around our new payment solution Aegis-1.  This open API client will allow vendors, anywhere, to accept payments with little to no setup costs.  Aegis-1 was designed to be adjustable in almost every aspect, customized directly to the vendors needs.  Aegis-1 requires anywhere from zero to four confirmations depending on the payment circumstance. Zero confirmation transactions are suitable to micropayments, such as a vending machine, but unsuitable for larger volume payments which would require more (2 to 4) confirmations."
