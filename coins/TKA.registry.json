    "en": "TOKIA is not a company which is here to fight the “greedy capitalists”. We leave that to the pundits whose loud voices might well exceed their actual competence. Economically viable, sustainable business models are key to stable and continuous existence of products and services which we depend on in our daily lives. However, here at TOKIA we also dare to call a spade a spade, and challenge the existing financial services landscape as they are simply not good enough."
